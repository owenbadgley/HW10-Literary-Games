# HW10-Literary-Games

  So far this semester, I think that Braid is the game that we have played that I enjoyed the most. I think that the central mechanic is both
clever and fun, and the story (before the oppneheimer bit) is also pretty clever and compelling. No matter how much I think Jonathan Blow 
is annoying, I still have to respect that he is a very smart person who makes incredible games. The witness is one of my favorite games of all
time. The way that I see video games being able to be "intellectual" is what Braid somewhat manages to do: Create a gameplay loop or mechanic 
that reinforces the core themes of the story, which I think the time rewind does with the story of Braid. I think another game that does this 
very well is Outer Wilds, because the core gameplay loop enforces what the ultimate lesson of the game is. Speaking of Outer Wilds, I think 
thatgame is a very good example of what Jagoda is trying to say in his chapter. The game is perfect for experimentation. It allows the 
player to do things that they never could have hoped to do otherwise. It satisfies the want to explore.
  On the other hand, my paper prototype completely reworked my plan for my game. Instead of controlling two characters at once, I decided to
just make it a two player puzzle platformer. I thought that that would be much more fun, and also could have some interesting story vibes. 
I have decided to make it a sort of inside out style game. The idea is that there are two conflicting emotions, and each player must play as 
one of them. The goal of each level is to unite the two emotions, or maybe the goal of each world. Or maybe very long levels. I'll figure that 
out. I think this could lead for some literary stuff, if explored to it's fullest potential. All in all, I think that the prototype went quite 
well. I have a sort of first tutorial level sketched out that I want to try to make, which will be hard. That's my next step. I have 
successfully created two playable characters, that can be controlled at the same time using one keyboard. They are both godotbots but other 
than that it is going very well. There is also only a floor. One of my ideas was to add abilities for each character, so I will have to figure
out how to do that next. Or build the level next. I don't know which one I want to try, but I will do one of the two next to create this
prototype level.
